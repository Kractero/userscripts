# NationStates Scripts
Various userscripts for trading cards. I use these with [FireMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firemonkey/) but it also works with Tampermonkey.

Scripts:
1. Legendary Notify - [Install](https://github.com/Kractero/userscripts/raw/main/legendaryNotify.user.js)

   Makes legendary cards and cards with value over 1.50 (configurable) from packs larger and plays a sound when one is found. Some browsers may block NationStates from sending audio, which you can see near the address bar. They also spin around in a circle.

   Also works with gotIssues by closing any pack that doesn't contain either of the qualifications.
   
2. Move Effects - [Install](https://github.com/Kractero/userscripts/raw/main/moveEffects.user.js)

   Moves the issue stats results to the top of the page and sorts them by your world census rankings.

3. Puppet Switcher - [Install](https://github.com/Kractero/userscripts/raw/main/puppetSwitcher.user.js)

   Personal hotkey suite that lets you switch between puppets, for use with containerise. Standalone, largely replaced by Got Issues but I still use this on the nations I manually farm for stat reasons.

4. Quick Puppet Mover - [Install](https://github.com/Kractero/userscripts/raw/main/quickPuppetMover.user.js)

   Keybindings to move a new puppet to a region and set their flag. Used with Racoda's puppet creation assistant.

5. CSB Suite - [Install](https://github.com/Kractero/userscripts/raw/main/csb.user.js)

   Mobile friendly keybindings for user CSB, essentially a mobile friendly combination of 3 and 6.

6. Quick Junker - [Install](https://github.com/Kractero/userscripts/raw/main/quickJunker.user.js)
   
   Keybindings to quickly navigate a deck and junk cards.
